# rs-edlib
Rust implementation of [edlib](https://github.com/Martinsos/edlib/tree/master).

Two reasons:
1. For learning purposes. Interested after reading about it in [`Racon`](https://genome.cshlp.org/content/27/5/737.full.pdf).
2. [`edlib-rs`](https://github.com/jean-pierreBoth/edlib-rs/tree/master) cmake build script is broken and the crate is just a thin wrapper for the C++ lib.
